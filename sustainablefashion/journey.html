            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>Eco Sphere began its journey in December 2024 with a vision to redefine the fashion industry. Our mission was simple yet profound: to create beautiful, high-quality fashion while preserving the planet for future generations. Founded on the principles of sustainability, we are proud to be a part of a global movement toward responsible consumption.</p>
            <p>Starting as a small initiative, Eco Sphere has grown to become a trusted name in sustainable fashion. Our commitment to transparency and ethical practices drives everything we do.</p>
